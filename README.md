# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jon Helge SkjÃ¦rstein
<p align="left">I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer from Norway, with a keen interest in tech and automation through CI/CD. I enjoy working with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, setting up virtual machines to host my Express servers, and using SSH for secure access. I create webpages that interact with MongoDB using Mongoose for schema management. Additionally, I'm enthusiastic about learning and find Python particularly fun, especially when using SQLAlchemy with MySQL. I also utilize Supabase for secure platform authentication, including third-party login integrations.</p>
